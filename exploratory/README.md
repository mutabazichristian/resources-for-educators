# **Python Web Dev Resources for Educators** 🎓🚀  

## **About This Repo**  
Welcome, educators! 👋 This repository is packed with **fun, beginner-friendly Python projects** designed to help **you** teach students (ages 12-18) the magic of coding—without the stress.  

⚠️ **Heads up!** This is strictly for **teachers and mentors**, not students. The code here is meant as a **reference**—not something to copy-paste straight into a lesson. Feel free to tweak, remix, and make it your own!  

## **What’s Inside?**  

### 🔹 **Exploratory Python (Beginner)**  
Perfect for students just getting started. Covers Python basics with small, interactive projects to get them hooked!  

### 🔹 **Intermediate Python**  
Takes things up a notch with data structures, file handling, and object-oriented programming—without making heads explode.  

### 🔹 **Advanced Python (Web Dev Edition)**  
A gentle intro to **Flask** and web development, guiding students through building simple apps, handling user input, and even deploying tiny projects.  

## **How to Use These Resources**  
✅ **Adapt freely** – Every class is different! Modify the projects to fit your students' pace and interests.  
✅ **Encourage creativity** – The goal isn’t copying code; it’s understanding and experimenting!  
✅ **Keep it fun** – Learning is way better when it doesn’t feel like work.  

Happy teaching! 🎉
